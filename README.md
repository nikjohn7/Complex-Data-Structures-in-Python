# Complex Data Structures in Python

This repo consists of some codes I wrote while practicing data structures in Python, mainly based out of Codecademy

The data structures covered in this repo are:

- HashMaps
- Trees
- Heaps
- Graphs



## File information

Each folder contains files in the following format:

- `script.py` : This contains the code implementing the functioning of the respective data structure
- `<data structure>_cheatsheet.pdf` : This is a cheatsheet for the data structure
- `project` : This folder contains files implementing a project related to the corresponding data structure
